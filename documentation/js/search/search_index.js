movies as a vertical list of ten movies which can also be filtered by decade.\nA UI mockup can be found in the included moviemock.sketch file (or moviemock.pdf if you don't have Sketch).\nOnly one movie is shown in the mockup, but use that as a template for the other 9.\nRequirements\n\nBuild using the latest version of AngularJS or Angular, whichever is most comfortable to you.\nUse SASS to write your css and compile it down.\nWrite your JavaScript using either vanilla js or using TypeScript and compile it down.\nBuild and include at least one Angular component.\nMake sure your code is supported by Chrome, FF, and IE11.\nPublish your completed project to a github repo provide us with a link.\n\nAPIs\nSign up for a free api key to use the Movie service here:\nhttp://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx\nUsing the first 10 results of this api search for batman movies:\nhttp://www.omdbapi.com/?s=Batman\nTake those results and look up details for each movie returned using this api pattern:\nhttp://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt0372784 (where i = the imdb id found above)\nHint: Images will be blocked from hotlinking. Manually download all of those images to the project first, then reference them locally (parse the url string from the response).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
